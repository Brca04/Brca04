# Hi there! <img src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/e3d1f8e8-c98d-4376-a7d4-fbdc86941b4f" height="30"/>

My name is Bruno. I’m currently pursuing a Bachelor's degree in Computer Science at [FER](https://www.fer.unizg.hr/#). My main area of interest is AI and its applications in everyday life.

#
🔭 I’m currently working on a web app for dog walkers, a simple car driving simulation, Discord bots, and more.
#
🌱 I’m currently learning about machine learning, PyTorch, and data analysis.
#
⚡ Fun fact: At the age of 12, I started coding so I could drive an mBot around the track we made at school, which then led me to learning Python and eventually into Computer Science.
